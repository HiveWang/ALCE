There is a higher than 90% chance of someone sharing at least a birthday with someone else in a group of more than 300 million people in the US [2]. 
The birthday paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday [4]. 
To do better than a 50/50 chance of two people sharing the same birthday, you would have to get together in a room with more than 23 people [1][4][5]. 
In a group of 44 people, there's a 93% chance that two of them could share a birthday [1]. 
Therefore, it is possible to have over a 90% chance for two people, out of a group of 50, to share the same birthday."

Scotland and Ireland have different historical, political and economic backgrounds that have influenced their independence movements. Scotland has been able to plan a referendum on independence because of its unique relationship with the UK and the support of the Scottish National Party [2][3][4]. On the other hand, Ireland has been fighting for independence for decades due to its history of colonization, political instability and religious conflicts [5]. It is important to note that the independence movements of both countries are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be fully explained by a single factor."

Scotland is planning a referendum on independence, while Ireland has been fighting for independence for decades because they have different historical and political contexts [1][4]. Scotland's independence referendum was held in 2014, and the idea of a second referendum on independence has been proposed after the Brexit vote [3][4]. On the other hand, Ireland has been fighting for independence since the early 1600s [4]. It is suggested that there ought to be another Scottish independence referendum once Britain leaves the EU because Scotland voted strongly to remain in the EU at the 2015 referendum [4]. The idea of Northern Ireland joining the Republic of Ireland has also been suggested after Brexit [4].
